# Hello! ✿

Currently working with @jesseplusplus to build [frequency.app](https://frequency.app) : <br>
a decentralized social media platform that values transparency, data privacy, and mental well-being.  
<br>
<Br>
Social media companies are notorious for putting the objectives of those who pay them first over the mental well-being of their consumers.  

At frequency.app, we aim to give people control over their digital environment&mdash;to make social media as mindful or as distracting as one would like it to be.  
We want to give people the option to have a private, distraction-free, ad-free, recommender-algorithm-free, data tracking-to-be-sold-to-third-parties-free experience.  

I hope you’ll come check out what we’re up to!
